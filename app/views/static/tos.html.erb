Dispute Resolution and Arbitration. 
Negotiations. Before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding, you and Pigeon Loft Pty Ltd agree to first attempt to negotiate any dispute, controversy or claim related to these ToS ("Claim") (except those Claims expressly provided in Section 20.6 below) informally for at least thirty (30) days. Negotiations will begin upon written notice. Pigeon Loft Pty Ltd will send its notice to your billing address and email you a copy to the email address you have provided to us. You will send your notice to Pigeon Loft Pty Ltd at 800 Market St. Suite 600 San Francisco, CA 94102, ATTN: CEO. 
Binding Arbitration. If the parties fail to resolve a Claim through negotiations, within such thirty (30)-day period, either you or Pigeon Loft Pty Ltd may elect to have the Claim (except as otherwise provided in Section 20.6) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the "JAMS Rules") and under the terms set forth in this ToS. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section 20 and the JAMS Rules, the terms in this Section 20 will control and prevail.   Except as otherwise set forth in Section 20.6, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and we will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator's decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator's findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator's decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this ToS, (i) you and Pigeon Loft Pty Ltd may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator's decision is final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.   BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND Pigeon Loft Pty Ltd ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. 
Arbitration Fees. If you initiate arbitration for a Claim, you will only need to pay an arbitration initiation fee of $250 and we will pay all other costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration. If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration. All other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged pursuant to the JAMS Rules. Notwithstanding Section 21.5 of this ToS to the contrary, you will not be required to pay our attorneys' fees or other costs if you do not prevail in the arbitration. 
Location. The arbitration will take place in your hometown area if you so notify Pigeon Loft Pty Ltd in your notice of arbitration or within ten (10) days following receipt of Pigeon Loft Pty Ltd's arbitration notice. In the absence of a notice to conduct the arbitration in your hometown area, the arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco, California, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances. Any Claim not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction in San Francisco, California, United States of America, and you and Pigeon Loft Pty Ltd agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court. 
Limitations. You and Pigeon Loft Pty Ltd agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between Pigeon Loft Pty Ltd and you individually.   YOU AND PIGEON LOFT PTY LTD AGREE THAT (A) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (B) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (C) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER.
Exceptions to Negotiations and Arbitration. You and Pigeon Loft Pty Ltd agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Pigeon Loft Pty Ltd's intellectual property rights; (ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courts' jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration. 
Governing Law. Except as otherwise provided in this ToS, this ToS shall be is governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of California, without regard to choice of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
Severability. You and Pigeon Loft Pty Ltd agree that if any portion this Section 20 is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section 20.6), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section 20.6 is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Pigeon Loft Pty Ltd will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section 20.6 found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within San Francisco, State of California, United States of America, and you and Pigeon Loft Pty Ltd agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
